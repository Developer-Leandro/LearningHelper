# Phyton Version

This code should work with Python 3.x versions, such as Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9. It is recommended to use the latest stable version of Python 3 available at the time of executing the code.
To check your Python version, you can open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

If you have Python 3 installed, it should display the version number. If you don't have Python installed or if you have Python 2 installed, you may need to install Python 3 before running the code.

You can download and install Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
